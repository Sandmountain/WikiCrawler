# WikiCrawler

Live demo @ https://sandmountain.github.io/WikiCrawler/


## Rules and info (same as in game)
The purpose of this game is to reach a chosen Wikipedia article, starting from another. This is done by clicking or selecting a section of words in the articles. Either choose your own start and finishing article, or choose a random article from a set of words sorted by different categories.


When playing the game, you can see your current time passed and number of articles you have visited in the upper right hand corner. It's also possible to go back one article by pressing the panel in the lower left corner, this could be usefull if a word was pressed by mistake.


The highscore is calculated by the number of clicks and time spent to reach the chosen article, so be careful, and be quick!
